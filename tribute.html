           <strong>The Birth of Jesus</strong>
           <br>
           <br>
           <span class="incd-verse">1</span>At that time the Roman emperor, Augustus, decreed that a census should be taken throughout the Roman Empire.<span class="verse">2</span> (This was the first census taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria.)<span class="verse">3</span> All returned to their own ancestral towns to register for this census. And because Joseph was a descendant of King David, he had to go to Bethlehem in Judea, David's ancient home. He traveled there from the village of Nazareth in Galilee. He took with him Mary, to whom he was engaged, who was now expecting a child.
           <br>
           <span class="incd"></span>And while they were there, the time came for her baby to be born. She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no lodging available for them.

            <br>
            <strong>The Sheperds and Angels</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
             That night there were shepherds staying in the fields nearby, guarding their flocks of sheep. Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared among them, and the radiance of the Lord's glory surrounded them. They were terrified, but the angel reasured them. <em>"Don't be afraid!"</em> he said. <em>"I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people. The Savior -yes, the Messiah, the Lord-has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David! And you will recognize him by this sign: You will find a baby wrapped snugly in strips of cloth, lying in a manger."</em> Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast host of others-the armies of heaven-praising God and saying. <em>"Glory to God in highest heaven, and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased."</em><br>When the angels had returned to heaven, the shepherds said to each other, <em>"Let's go to Bethlehem! Let's see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about".</em>
             <br>
             They hurried to the village and found Mary and Joseph. And there was the baby, lying in  the manger. After seeing him, the shepherds told everyone what had happended and what the angel had said to them about this child. All who heard the shepherds' story were astonished, but Mary kept all these things in her heart and thought about them often. The shepherds went back to their flocks, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen. It was just as the angel had told them.</div>

            <strong>Jesus Speaks with the Teachers</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            Every year Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem for the Passover festival. When Jesus was twelve, they attended the festival as usual. After the celebration was over, they started home to Nazareth, but Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents didn't miss him at first, because they assumed he was among the other travelers. But when he didn't show up that evening, they started looking for him among their relatives and friends.
            <br>
             When they couldn't find him, they went back to Jerusalem to search for him there. Three days later they finally discovered him in the Temple, sitting among the religious teachers, listening to them and asking questions. All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
             <br>
              His parents didn't know what to think. <em>"Son,"</em> his mother sais to him, <em>"why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been frantic, searching for you everywhere."</em> <span class="red">
                <br>
                "But why did you need to search?"</span> he asked. <span class="red">"Didn't you know that I must be in my Father's house?"</span> But they didn't understand what he meant.
                <br> 
                Then he returned to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. And his mother stored all these things in her heart.
                <br>
                 Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and all the people. </div>

            <br>
            <br>
            Then Jesus went from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John. But John tried to talk him out of it. <em>"I am the one who needs to be baptized by you,"</em> he said, <em>"so why are you coming to me?"</em>
            <br>
            But Jesus said, <span class="red">It should be done, for we must carry out all that God requires."</span> So John agreed to baptize him.
            <br>
            After his baptism, as Jesus came up out of the water, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and settling on him.
            <br>
            And a voice from heaven said, <em>This is my dearly Son, who brings me great joy."</em></div>

            <strong>The Temptation of Jesus</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan River. He was led by the Spirit in the wilderness, where he was tempted by the devil for forty days. Jesus ate nothing all that time and became veru hungry.
            <br>
            Then the devil said to him, <em>"If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread."</em>
            <br>
            But Jesus told him, <span class="red">"No! The Scriptures say, 'People do not live by bread alone.'"</span>
            <br>
            Then the devil took him up and revealed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. <em>"I will give you the glory of these kingdoms and authority over them,"</em> the devil said, <em>"because they are mine to give to anyone I please. I will give it all to you if you will worship me."</em>
            <br>
            Jesus replied, <span class="red">"The Scriptures say,
              <br>
              'You must worship the LORD your God
              <br>
              and serve only him.'"</span>
              <br>
              Then the devil took him to Jerusalem, to the highest point of the Temple, and said, <em>"If you are the Son of God, jump off! For the Scriptures say,
                <br>
                He will order his angels to protect and guard you.
                <br>
                And they will hold you up with their hands

                <br>
                Jesus responded, <span class="red">"The Scriptures also say, 'You must not test the LORD your God,'"</span>
                <br>
                When the devil had finished tempting Jesus, he left him until the next opportunity came.</div>

            <strong>The Wedding at Cana</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            The next day there was a wedding celebration in the village of Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there, and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the celebration. The wine supply ran out during the festivities, so Jesus' mother told him, <em>"They have no more wine."</em>
            <br>
            <span class="red">"Dear woman, that's not our problem," </span>Jesus replied. <span class="red">"My time has not yet come."</span>
            <br>
            But his mother told the servants, <em>"Do whatever he tells you."</em>
            <br>
            Standing nearby were six stone water jars, used for Jewish ceremonial washing. Each could hold twenty to thirty gallons.
            <br>
            Jesus told the servants, <span class="red">"Fill the jars with water."</span> When the jars had been filled, he said, <span class="red">"Now dip some out, and take it to the master of ceremonies."</span> So the servants followed his instructions.
            <br>
            When the master of ceremonies tasted the water that was now wine, not knowing where it had come from (though, of course, the servants knew), he called the bridegroom over. <em>"A host always serves the best wine first,"</em> he said. <em>Then, when everyone has had a lot to drink, he brings out the less expensive wine. But you have kept the best until now!"</em>

            One day soon afterward Jesus went up on a mountain to pray, and he prayed to God all night. At daybreak he called together all of his disciples and chose twelve of them to be apostles. Here are their names:
            <br>
            <br>
            Simon (whom he named Peter),

            Simon (who was called the zealot),
            <br>
            Judas (son of James),
            <br>
            Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed him).

            <strong>Jesus Feeds Five Thousand</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            After this, Jesus crossed over to far side of the Sea of Galilee, also known as the Sea of Tiberias.
            <br>
            A huge crowd kept following him wherever he went, because they saw his miraculous signs as he healed the sick. Then Jesus climbed a hill and sat down with his disciples around him. (It was nearly time for the Jewish Passover celebration.) Jesus soon saw a huge crowd of people coming to look for him. Turning to Philip, he asked, <span class="red">"Where can we buy bread to feed all these people?"</span> He was testing Philip, for he already knew what he was going to do.
            <br>
            Philip replied, <em>"Even if we worked for months, we wouldn't have enough money to feed them!"</em>
            <br>
            Then Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up. <em>"There's a young boy here with five barley loaves and two fish. But what good is that with this huge crowd?"</em>
            <br>
            <span>"Tell everyone to sit down,"</span>Jesus said. So they all sat down on the grassy slopes. (The men alone numbered about 5,000.) Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks to God, and distributed them to the people. Afterward he did the same with the fish. And they all ate as much as they wanted. After everyone was full, Jesus told his disciples, <span>"Now gather the leftovers, so that nothing is wasted."</span> So they picked up the pieces and filled twelve baskets with scraps left by the people who had eaten from the five barley loaves.

              <br>
              <br>
              Immediately after this, Jesus insisted that his disciples get back into the boat and head across the lake to Bethsaida, while he sent the people home. After telling everyone good-bye, he went up into the hills by himself to pray.
              <br>
              Late that night, the disciples were in their boat in the middle of the lake, and Jesus was alone on land. He saw that they were in serious trouble, rowing hard and struggling against the wind and waves. About three o'clock in the morning Jesus came toward them, walking on the water. He intended to go past them, but when they saw him walking on the water, they cried out of terror, thinking he was a ghost. They were all terrified when they saw him.
              <br>
              But Jesus spoke to them at once. <span class="red">"Don't be afraid,"</span> he said. <span class="red">"Take courage! I am here!"</span>
              <br>
              Then he climbed into the boat, and the wind stopped. They werre totally amazed, for they still didn't understand the significance of the miracle of the loaves. Their hearts were too hard to take it in.

            <strong>The Raising of Lazarus</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="incd-verse">1</span>A man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in Bethany with his sisters, Mary and Martha.<span class="verse">2</span> This is the Mary who later poured the expensive perfume on the Lord’s feet and wiped them with her hair. Her brother, Lazarus, was sick.<span class="verse">3</span> So the two sisters sent a message to Jesus telling him, <em>“Lord, your dear friend is very sick.”</em>
            <br>
            <span class="incd-verse">4</span> But when Jesus heard about it he said, <span class="red">“Lazarus’s sickness will not end in death. No, it happened for the glory of God so that the Son of God will receive glory from this.” </span><span class="verse">5</span> So although Jesus loved Martha, Mary, and Lazarus,<span class="verse">6</span> he stayed where he was for the next two days. <span class="verse">7</span> Finally, he said to his disciples, <span class="red">“Let’s go back to Judea.”</span>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">8</span> But his disciples objected. <em>“Rabbi,”</em> they said, <em>“only a few days ago the people in Judea were trying to stone you. Are you going there again?”</em>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">9</span> Jesus replied, <span class="red">“There are twelve hours of daylight every day. During the day people can walk safely. They can see because they have the light of this world. 10 But at night there is danger of stumbling because they have no light.”</span> <span class="verse">11</span> Then he said, <span class="red">“Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but now I will go and wake him up.”</span>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">12</span> The disciples said, <em>“Lord, if he is sleeping, he will soon get better!”</em> <span class="verse">13</span> They thought Jesus meant Lazarus was simply sleeping, but Jesus meant Lazarus had died.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">14</span> So he told them plainly, <span class="red">“Lazarus is dead. <span class="verse">15</span> And for your sakes, I’m glad I wasn’t there, for now you will really believe. Come, let’s go see him.”</span>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">16</span> Thomas, nicknamed the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, <em>“Let’s go, too—and die with Jesus.”</em>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">17</span> When Jesus arrived at Bethany, he was told that Lazarus had already been in his grave for four days. <span class="verse">18</span> Bethany was only a few miles down the road from Jerusalem, <span class="verse">19</span> and many of the people had come to console Martha and Mary in their loss. <span class="verse">20</span> When Martha got word that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him. But Mary stayed in the house. <span class="verse">21</span> Martha said to Jesus, <em>“Lord, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died. <span class="verse">22</span> But even now I know that God will give you whatever you ask.”</em>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">23</span> Jesus told her, <span class="red">“Your brother will rise again.”</span>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">24</span> <em>“Yes,”</em> Martha said, <em>“he will rise when everyone else rises, at the last day.”</em>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">25</span> Jesus told her, <span>“I am the resurrection and the life. Anyone who believes in me will live, even after dying. <span class="verse">26</span> Everyone who lives in me and believes in me will never ever die. Do you believe this, Martha?”</span>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">27</span> <em>“Yes, Lord,”</em> she told him. <em>“I have always believed you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one who has come into the world from God.”</em> <span class="verse">28</span> Then she returned to Mary. She called Mary aside from the mourners and told her, <em>“The Teacher is here and wants to see you.”</em> <span class="verse">29</span> So Mary immediately went to him.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">30</span> Jesus had stayed outside the village, at the place where Martha met him. <span class="verse">31</span> When the people who were at the house consoling Mary saw her leave so hastily, they assumed she was going to Lazarus’s grave to weep. So they followed her there. <span class="verse">32</span> When Mary arrived and saw Jesus, she fell at his feet and said, <em>“Lord, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died.”</em>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">33</span> When Jesus saw her weeping and saw the other people wailing with her, a deep anger welled up within him, and he was deeply troubled. <span class="verse">34</span> <span class="red">“Where have you put him?”</span> he asked them.
<br>
<span class="incd"></span>They told him, <em>“Lord, come and see.”</em> <span class="verse">35</span> Then Jesus wept. <span class="verse">36</span> The people who were standing nearby said, <em>“See how much he loved him!”</em> <span class="verse">37</span> But some said, <em>“This man healed a blind man. Couldn’t he have kept Lazarus from dying?”</em>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">38</span> Jesus was still angry as he arrived at the tomb, a cave with a stone rolled across its entrance. <span class="verse">39</span> <span class="red">“Roll the stone aside,”</span> Jesus told them.
<br>
<span class="incd"></span>But Martha, the dead man’s sister, protested, <em>“Lord, he has been dead for four days. The smell will be terrible.”</em>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">40</span> Jesus responded, <span class="red">“Didn’t I tell you that you would see God’s glory if you believe?”</span> <span class="verse">41</span> So they rolled the stone aside. Then Jesus looked up to heaven and said, <span class="red">“Father, thank you for hearing me. <span class="verse">42</span> You always hear me, but I said it out loud for the sake of all these people standing here, so that they will believe you sent me.”</span> <span class="verse">43</span> Then Jesus shouted, <span class="red">“Lazarus, come out!”</span> <span class="verse">44</span> And the dead man came out, his hands and feet bound in graveclothes, his face wrapped in a headcloth. Jesus told them, <span class="red">“Unwrap him and let him go!”</span>

            <strong>The Sermon on the Mount</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="incd-verse">1</span> One day as he saw the crowds gathering, Jesus went up on the mountainside and sat down. His disciples gathered around him, <span class="verse">2</span> and he began to teach them.

            <br>
<strong>The Beatitudes</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="incd-verse">3</span> “God blesses those who are poor and realize their need for him,
<br>
    for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.
    <br>
<span class="incd-verse">4</span> God blesses those who mourn,
<br>
    for they will be comforted.
    <br>
<span class="incd-verse">5</span> God blesses those who are humble,
<br>
    for they will inherit the whole earth.
    <br>
<span class="incd-verse">6</span> God blesses those who hunger and thirst for justice,
<br>
    for they will be satisfied.
    <br>
<span class="incd-verse">7</span> God blesses those who are merciful,
<br>
    for they will be shown mercy.
    <br>
<span class="incd-verse">8</span> God blesses those whose hearts are pure,
<br>
    for they will see God.
    <br>
<span class="incd-verse">9</span> God blesses those who work for peace,
<br>
    for they will be called the children of God.
    <br>
<span class="incd-verse">10</span> God blesses those who are persecuted for doing right,
<br>
    for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.
<br>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">11</span> “God blesses you when people mock you and persecute you and lie about you and say all sorts of evil things against you because you are my followers. <span class="verse">12</span> Be happy about it! Be very glad! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. And remember, the ancient prophets were persecuted in the same way.</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Teaching about Salt and Light</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="incd-verse">13</span> “You are the salt of the earth. But what good is salt if it has lost its flavor? Can you make it salty again? It will be thrown out and trampled underfoot as worthless.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">14</span> “You are the light of the world—like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden. <span class="verse">15</span> No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket. Instead, a lamp is placed on a stand, where it gives light to everyone in the house. <span class="verse">16</span> In the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly Father.</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Teaching about the Law</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="incd-verse">17</span> “Don’t misunderstand why I have come. I did not come to abolish the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets. No, I came to accomplish their purpose. <span class="verse">18</span> I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not even the smallest detail of God’s law will disappear until its purpose is achieved. <span class="verse">19</span> So if you ignore the least commandment and teach others to do the same, you will be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven. But anyone who obeys God’s laws and teaches them will be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">20</span> “But I warn you—unless your righteousness is better than the righteousness of the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven!</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Teaching about Anger</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="incd-verse">21</span> “You have heard that our ancestors were told, ‘You must not murder. If you commit murder, you are subject to judgment.’ <span class="verse">22</span> But I say, if you are even angry with someone, you are subject to judgment! If you call someone an idiot, you are in danger of being brought before the court. And if you curse someone, you are in danger of the fires of hell.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">23</span> “So if you are presenting a sacrifice at the altar in the Temple and you suddenly remember that someone has something against you, <span class="verse">24</span> leave your sacrifice there at the altar. Go and be reconciled to that person. Then come and offer your sacrifice to God.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">25</span> “When you are on the way to court with your adversary, settle your differences quickly. Otherwise, your accuser may hand you over to the judge, who will hand you over to an officer, and you will be thrown into prison. <span class="verse">26</span> And if that happens, you surely won’t be free again until you have paid the last penny.</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Teaching about Adultery</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="incd-verse">27</span> “You have heard the commandment that says, ‘You must not commit adultery.’ <span class="verse">28</span> But I say, anyone who even looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart. <span class="verse">29</span> So if your eye—even your good eye —causes you to lust, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. <span class="verse">30</span> And if your hand—even your stronger hand —causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Teaching about Divorce</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="incd-verse">31</span> “You have heard the law that says, ‘A man can divorce his wife by merely giving her a written notice of divorce.’ <span class="verse">32</span> But I say that a man who divorces his wife, unless she has been unfaithful, causes her to commit adultery. And anyone who marries a divorced woman also commits adultery.</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Teaching about Vows</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="verse">33</span> “You have also heard that our ancestors were told, ‘You must not break your vows; you must carry out the vows you make to the Lord.’ <span class="verse">34</span> But I say, do not make any vows! Do not say, ‘By heaven!’ because heaven is God’s throne. <span class="verse">35</span> And do not say, ‘By the earth!’ because the earth is his footstool. And do not say, ‘By Jerusalem!’ for Jerusalem is the city of the great King. <span class="verse">36</span> Do not even say, ‘By my head!’ for you can’t turn one hair white or black. <span class="verse">37</span> Just say a simple, ‘Yes, I will,’ or ‘No, I won’t.’ Anything beyond this is from the evil one.</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Teaching about Revenge</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"> “You have heard the law that says the punishment must match the injury: ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’ <span class="verse">39</span> But I say, do not resist an evil person! If someone slaps you on the right cheek, offer the other cheek also. <span class="verse">40</span> If you are sued in court and your shirt is taken from you, give your coat, too. <span class="verse">41</span> If a soldier demands that you carry his gear for a mile, carry it two miles. <span class="verse">42</span> Give to those who ask, and don’t turn away from those who want to borrow.</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Teaching about Love for Enemies</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="incd-verse">43</span> “You have heard the law that says, ‘Love your neighbor’ and hate your enemy. <span class="verse">44</span> But I say, love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you! <span class="verse">45</span> In that way, you will be acting as true children of your Father in heaven. For he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust alike. <span class="verse">46</span> If you love only those who love you, what reward is there for that? Even corrupt tax collectors do that much. <span class="verse">47</span> If you are kind only to your friends, how are you different from anyone else? Even pagans do that. <span class="verse">48</span> But you are to be perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Teaching about Giving to the Needy</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="incd-verse">1</span> “Watch out! Don’t do your good deeds publicly, to be admired by others, for you will lose the reward from your Father in heaven. <span class="verse">2</span> When you give to someone in need, don’t do as the hypocrites do—blowing trumpets in the synagogues and streets to call attention to their acts of charity! I tell you the truth, they have received all the reward they will ever get. <span class="verse">3</span> But when you give to someone in need, don’t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. <span class="verse">4</span> Give your gifts in private, and your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Teaching about Prayer and Fasting</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="incd-verse">5</span> “When you pray, don’t be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them. I tell you the truth, that is all the reward they will ever get. <span class="verse">6</span> But when you pray, go away by yourself, shut the door behind you, and pray to your Father in private. Then your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">7</span> “When you pray, don’t babble on and on as the Gentiles do. They think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again. <span class="verse">8</span> Don’t be like them, for your Father knows exactly what you need even before you ask him! <span class="verse">9</span> Pray like this:
<br>
<br>
Our Father in heaven,
<br>
    may your name be kept holy.
    <br>
<span class="incd-verse">10</span> May your Kingdom come soon.
<br>
May your will be done on earth,
<br>
    as it is in heaven.
    <br>
<span class="incd-verse">11</span> Give us today the food we need,
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">12</span> and forgive us our sins,
<br>
    as we have forgiven those who sin against us.
    <br>
<span class="incd-verse">13</span> And don’t let us yield to temptation,
<br>
    but rescue us from the evil one.
    <br>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">14</span> “If you forgive those who sin against you, your heavenly Father will forgive you. <span class="verse">15</span> But if you refuse to forgive others, your Father will not forgive your sins.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">16</span> “And when you fast, don’t make it obvious, as the hypocrites do, for they try to look miserable and disheveled so people will admire them for their fasting. I tell you the truth, that is the only reward they will ever get. <span class="verse">17</span> But when you fast, comb your hair and wash your face. <span class="verse">18</span> Then no one will notice that you are fasting, except your Father, who knows what you do in private. And your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Teaching about Money and Possessions</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="incd-verse">19</span> “Don’t store up treasures here on earth, where moths eat them and rust destroys them, and where thieves break in and steal. <span class="verse">20</span> Store your treasures in heaven, where moths and rust cannot destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal. <span class="verse">21</span> Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">22</span> “Your eye is like a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is filled with light. <span class="verse">23</span> But when your eye is unhealthy, your whole body is filled with darkness. And if the light you think you have is actually darkness, how deep that darkness is!
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">24</span> “No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and be enslaved to money.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">25</span> “That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life—whether you have enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isn’t life more than food, and your body more than clothing? <span class="verse">26</span> Look at the birds. They don’t plant or harvest or store food in barns, for your heavenly Father feeds them. And aren’t you far more valuable to him than they are? <span class="verse">27</span> Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">28</span> “And why worry about your clothing? Look at the lilies of the field and how they grow. They don’t work or make their clothing, <span class="verse">29</span> yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are. <span class="verse">30</span> And if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, he will certainly care for you. Why do you have so little faith?
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">31</span> “So don’t worry about these things, saying, ‘What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear?’ <span class="verse">32</span> These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers, but your heavenly Father already knows all your needs. <span class="verse">33</span> Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you need.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">34</span> “So don’t worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today’s trouble is enough for today.</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Do Not Judge Others</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="incd-verse">1</span> “Do not judge others, and you will not be judged. <span class="verse">2</span> For you will be treated as you treat others. The standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will be judged.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">3</span> “And why worry about a speck in your friend’s eye when you have a log in your own? <span class="verse">4</span> How can you think of saying to your friend, ‘Let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,’ when you can’t see past the log in your own eye? <span class="verse">5</span> Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend’s eye.
<br>
<span class="verse">6</span> “Don’t waste what is holy on people who are unholy. Don’t throw your pearls to pigs! They will trample the pearls, then turn and attack you.</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Effective Prayer</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="incd-verse">7</span> “Keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking, and you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you. <span class="verse">8</span> For everyone who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And to everyone who knocks, the door will be opened.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">9</span> “You parents—if your children ask for a loaf of bread, do you give them a stone instead? <span class="verse">10</span> Or if they ask for a fish, do you give them a snake? Of course not! <span class="verse">11</span> So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask him.</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>The Golden Rule</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="incd-verse">12</span> “Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you. This is the essence of all that is taught in the law and the prophets.</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>The Narrow Gate</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="incd-verse">13</span> “You can enter God’s Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way. <span class="verse">14</span> But the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult, and only a few ever find it.</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>The Tree and Its Fruit</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="incd-verse">15</span> “Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really vicious wolves. <span class="verse">16</span> You can identify them by their fruit, that is, by the way they act. Can you pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? <span class="verse">17</span> A good tree produces good fruit, and a bad tree produces bad fruit. <span class="verse">18</span> A good tree can’t produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can’t produce good fruit. <span class="verse">19</span> So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire. <span class="verse">20</span> Yes, just as you can identify a tree by its fruit, so you can identify people by their actions.</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>True Disciples</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="incd-verse">21</span> “Not everyone who calls out to me, ‘Lord! Lord!’ will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter. <span class="verse">22</span> On judgment day many will say to me, ‘Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.’ <span class="verse">23</span> But I will reply, ‘I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God’s laws.’</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Building on a Solid Foundation</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="red"><span class="incd-verse">24</span> “Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock. <span class="verse">25</span> Though the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise and the winds beat against that house, it won’t collapse because it is built on bedrock. <span class="verse">26</span> But anyone who hears my teaching and doesn’t obey it is foolish, like a person who builds a house on sand. <span class="verse">27</span> When the rains and floods come and the winds beat against that house, it will collapse with a mighty crash.”
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">28</span> When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, <span class="verse">29</span> for he taught with real authority—quite unlike their teachers of religious law.</span>

            <strong>Jesus and Zacchaeus</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="incd-verse">1</span> Jesus entered Jericho and made his way through the town. <span class="verse">2</span> There was a man there named Zacchaeus. He was the chief tax collector in the region, and he had become very rich. <span class="verse">3</span> He tried to get a look at Jesus, but he was too short to see over the crowd. <span class="verse">4</span> So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree beside the road, for Jesus was going to pass that way.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">5</span> When Jesus came by, he looked up at Zacchaeus and called him by name. <span class="red">“Zacchaeus!”</span> he said. <span class="red">“Quick, come down! I must be a guest in your home today.”</span>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">6</span> Zacchaeus quickly climbed down and took Jesus to his house in great excitement and joy. <span class="verse">7</span> But the people were displeased. <em>“He has gone to be the guest of a notorious sinner,”</em> they grumbled.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">8</span> Meanwhile, Zacchaeus stood before the Lord and said, <em>“I will give half my wealth to the poor, Lord, and if I have cheated people on their taxes, I will give them back four times as much!”</em>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">9</span> Jesus responded, <span class="red">“Salvation has come to this home today, for this man has shown himself to be a true son of Abraham. <span class="verse">10</span> For the Son of Man came to seek and save those who are lost.”</span>

          <strong>Jesus' Triumphant Entry</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="incd-verse">28</span> After telling this story, Jesus went on toward Jerusalem, walking ahead of his disciples. <span class="verse">29</span> As he came to the towns of Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives, he sent two disciples ahead. <span class="verse">30</span> <span class="red">“Go into that village over there,”</span> he told them. <span class="red">“As you enter it, you will see a young donkey tied there that no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here. <span class="verse">31</span> If anyone asks, ‘Why are you untying that colt?’ just say, ‘The Lord needs it.’”</span>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">32</span> So they went and found the colt, just as Jesus had said. <span class="verse">33</span> And sure enough, as they were untying it, the owners asked them, <em>“Why are you untying that colt?”</em>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">34</span> And the disciples simply replied, <em>“The Lord needs it.”</em> <span class="verse">35</span> So they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their garments over it for him to ride on.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">36</span> As he rode along, the crowds spread out their garments on the road ahead of him. <span class="verse">37</span> When he reached the place where the road started down the Mount of Olives, all of his followers began to shout and sing as they walked along, praising God for all the wonderful miracles they had seen.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">38</span> “Blessings on the King who comes in the name of the Lord!
<br>
    <span class="incd"></span>Peace in heaven, and glory in highest heaven!”
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">39</span> But some of the Pharisees among the crowd said, <em>“Teacher, rebuke your followers for saying things like that!”</em>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">40</span> He replied, <span class="red">“If they kept quiet, the stones along the road would burst into cheers!”</span>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Jesus Weeps over Jerusalem</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">41</span> But as he came closer to Jerusalem and saw the city ahead, he began to weep. <span class="verse">42</span> <span class="red">“How I wish today that you of all people would understand the way to peace. But now it is too late, and peace is hidden from your eyes. <span class="verse">43</span> Before long your enemies will build ramparts against your walls and encircle you and close in on you from every side. <span class="verse">44</span> They will crush you into the ground, and your children with you. Your enemies will not leave a single stone in place, because you did not recognize it when God visited you.”</span>

            <br>
            <span class="incd-verse">17</span> On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, <em>“Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?”</em>

<span class="incd-verse">18</span> <span class="red">“As you go into the city,”</span> he told them, <span class="red">“you will see a certain man.

<br>
<span class="incd-verse">20</span> When it was evening, Jesus sat down at the table with the Twelve. <span class="verse">21</span> While they were eating, he said, <span class="red">“I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me.”</span>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">22</span> Greatly distressed, each one asked in turn, <em>“Am I the one, Lord?”</em>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">23</span> He replied, <span class="red">“One of you who has just eaten from this bowl with me will betray me. <span class="verse">24</span> For the Son of Man must die, as the Scriptures declared long ago.

<span class="incd-verse">25</span> Judas, the one who would betray him, also asked, <em>“Rabbi, am I the one?”</em>
<br>
<span class="incd"></span>And Jesus told him, <span class="red">“You have said it.”</span>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">26</span> As they were eating, Jesus took some bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, <span class="red">“Take this and eat it, for this is my body.”</span>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">27</span> And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. He gave it to them and said, <span class="red">“Each of you drink from it, <span class="verse">28</span> for this is my blood, which confirms the covenant between God and his people. It is poured out as a sacrifice to forgive the sins of many. <span class="verse">29</span> Mark my words—I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new with you in my Father’s Kingdom.”</span>

            <strong>Jesus prays in Gethsemane.</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="incd-verse">36</span> Then Jesus went with them to the olive grove called Gethsemane, and he said, <span class="red">“Sit here while I go over there to pray.”</span> <span class="verse">37</span> He took Peter and Zebedee’s two sons, James and John, and he became anguished and distressed. <span class="verse">38</span> He told them, <span class="red">“My soul is crushed with grief to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.”</span>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">39</span> He went on a little farther and bowed with his face to the ground, praying, <span class="red">“My Father! If it is possible, let this cup of suffering be taken away from me. Yet I want your will to be done, not mine.”</span>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">40</span> Then he returned to the disciples and found them asleep. He said to Peter, <span class="red">“Couldn’t you watch with me even one hour? <span class="verse">41</span> Keep watch and pray, so that you will not give in to temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak!”</span>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">42</span> Then Jesus left them a second time and prayed, <span class="red">“My Father! If this cup cannot be taken away unless I drink it, your will be done.”</span> <span class="verse">43</span> When he returned to them again, he found them sleeping, for they couldn’t keep their eyes open.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">44</span> So he went to pray a third time, saying the same things again. <span class="verse">45</span> Then he came to the disciples and said, <span class="red">“Go ahead and sleep. Have your rest. But look—the time has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <span class="incd-verse">46</span> Up, let’s be going. Look, my betrayer is here!”</span>

            <br>
            <span class="incd-verse">47</span> But even as Jesus said this, a crowd approached, led by Judas, one of the twelve disciples.

<br>
<span class="incd-verse">49</span> When the other disciples saw what was about to happen, they exclaimed, <em>“Lord, should we fight? We brought the swords!”</em> <span class="verse">50</span> And one of them struck at the high priest’s slave, slashing off his right ear.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">51</span> But Jesus said, <span class="red">“No more of this.”</span> And he touched the man’s ear and healed him.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">52</span> Then Jesus spoke to the leading priests, the captains of the Temple guard, and the elders who had come for him. <span class="red">“Am I some dangerous revolutionary,”</span> he asked, <span class="red">“that you come with swords and clubs to arrest me? <span class="verse">53</span> Why didn’t you arrest me in the Temple?

            <strong>The Soldiers Mock Jesus</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="incd-verse">27</span> Some of the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into their headquarters and called out the entire regiment. <span class="verse">28</span> They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him. <span class="verse">29</span> They wove thorn branches into a crown and put it on his head, and they placed a reed stick in his right hand as a scepter. Then they knelt before him in mockery and taunted, <em>“Hail! King of the Jews!”</em> <span class="verse">30</span> And they spit on him and grabbed the stick and struck him on the head with it. <span class="verse">31</span> When they were finally tired of mocking him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him away to be crucified.
<br>
<br>
<strong>The Crucifixion</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">32</span> Along the way, they came across a man named Simon, who was from Cyrene, and the soldiers forced him to carry Jesus’ cross. <span class="verse">33</span> And they went out to a place called Golgotha (which means “Place of the Skull”). <span class="verse">34</span> The soldiers gave Jesus wine mixed with bitter gall, but when he had tasted it, he refused to drink it.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">35</span> After they had nailed him to the cross, the soldiers gambled for his clothes by throwing dice. <span class="verse">36</span> Then they sat around and kept guard as he hung there. <span class="verse">37</span> A sign was fastened above Jesus’ head, announcing the charge against him. It read: “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.” <span class="verse">38</span> Two revolutionaries were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">39</span> The people passing by shouted abuse, shaking their heads in mockery. <span class="incd-verse">40</span> <em>“Look at you now!”</em> they yelled at him. <em>“You said you were going to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days. Well then, if you are the Son of God, save yourself and come down from the cross!”</em>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">41</span> The leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the elders also mocked Jesus. <span class="verse">42</span> <em>“He saved others,”</em> they scoffed, <em>“but he can’t save himself! So he is the King of Israel, is he? Let him come down from the cross right now, and we will believe in him! <span class="verse">43</span> He trusted God, so let God rescue him now if he wants him! For he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”</em> <span class="verse">44</span> Even the revolutionaries who were crucified with him ridiculed him in the same way.
<br>
<br>
<strong>The Death of Jesus</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">45</span> At noon, darkness fell across the whole land until three o’clock. <span class="verse">46</span> At about three o’clock, Jesus called out with a loud voice, <span class="red">“Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?”</span> which means <span class="red">“My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?”</span>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">47</span> Some of the bystanders misunderstood and thought he was calling for the prophet Elijah. <span class="verse">48</span> One of them ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, holding it up to him on a reed stick so he could drink. <span class="verse">49</span> But the rest said, <em>“Wait! Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.”</em>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">50</span> Then Jesus shouted out again, and he released his spirit. <span class="verse">51</span> At that moment the curtain in the sanctuary of the Temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, rocks split apart, <span class="verse">52</span> and tombs opened. The bodies of many godly men and women who had died were raised from the dead. <span class="verse">53</span> They left the cemetery after Jesus’ resurrection, went into the holy city of Jerusalem, and appeared to many people.
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">54</span> The Roman officer and the other soldiers at the crucifixion were terrified by the earthquake and all that had happened. They said, <em>“This man truly was the Son of God!”</em>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">55</span> And many women who had come from Galilee with Jesus to care for him were watching from a distance. <span class="verse">56</span> Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary (the mother of James and Joseph), and the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee.

            <strong>The Burial of Jesus</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="incd-verse">57</span> As evening approached, Joseph, a rich man from Arimathea who had become a follower of Jesus, <span class="verse">58</span> went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. And Pilate issued an order to release it to him. <span class="verse">59</span> Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a long sheet of clean linen cloth. <span class="verse">60</span> He placed it in his own new tomb, which had been carved out of the rock. Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance and left.<span class="verse">61</span> Both Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting across from the tomb and watching.
            <br>
            <br>
<strong>The Guard at the Tomb</strong>
<br>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">62</span> The next day, on the Sabbath, the leading priests and Pharisees went to see Pilate. <span class="verse">63</span> They told him, <em>“Sir, we remember what that deceiver once said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise from the dead.’ <span class="verse">64</span> So we request that you seal the tomb until the third day. This will prevent his disciples from coming and stealing his body and then telling everyone he was raised from the dead! If that happens, we’ll be worse off than we were at first.”</em>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">65</span> Pilate replied, <em>“Take guards and secure it the best you can.”</em> <span class="verse">66</span> So they sealed the tomb and posted guards to protect it.

<br>
<span class="incd-verse">5</span> When they entered the tomb, they saw a young man clothed in a white robe sitting on the right side. The women were shocked, <span class="verse">6</span> but the angel said, <em>“Don’t be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He isn’t here! He is risen from the dead! Look, this is where they laid his body. <span class="verse">7</span> Now go and tell his disciples, including Peter, that Jesus is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you before he died.”</em>
<br>
<span class="incd-verse">8</span> The women fled from the tomb, trembling and bewildered, and they said nothing to anyone because they were too frightened.

<br>
